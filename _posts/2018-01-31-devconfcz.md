## Introduction

New year and January are the two keywords that mark the annual Developer
Conference (DevConf.cz) by Red Hat in Brno, Czech Republic. I've been given an opportunity to present (alongside great speaker from SPICE, [Christophe de Dinechin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christophe_de_Dinechin)) a topic that is close to me - GPUs and virtualization. The talk was called "Slicing a (v)GPU", as figuring how single GPU can be used my multiple VMs was the main topic. The recording is available at [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8b9jlFN-nk).
