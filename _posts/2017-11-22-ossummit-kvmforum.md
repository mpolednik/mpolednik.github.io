## Introduction

October was the month of Open Source Summit (LinuxCon, CloudOpen and many more events under one umbrella) and KVM Forum. This year, I'm thankful to have been given the opportunity to present talk "Maximizing VM Performance for Users" at the shared track of OSSummit and KVM Forum! Both [slides](https://schd.ws/hosted_files/osseu17/06/kvm_forum.pdf) and [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SlUlQRcnQg) are public!
